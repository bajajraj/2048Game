# 2048 Game

This is a simple 2048 game that was created as part of final exam for the Android Development Class. The best part of the project was that it was just completed in 2 hours of time. This includes the time to think about the project and to code it.

It is created using Android Studio and works only on Android Apps. The programming language to code the game was Java and Android Studio API was used.
